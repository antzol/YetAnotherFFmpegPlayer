# Yet Another FFmpeg Player
Simple media player based on Qt framework and FFmpeg/LibAV library.

This project focuses on how FFmpeg works with MPEG2-TS transport streams and broadcast-specific video (e.g. interlaced video, or 720x576 resolution with 16 empty pixels per line, etc.), but also works with regular media files.

## Some screenshots

- Playback of the MPTS from file with recorded MPEG2-TS stream:

## TODO

- Display information about currently playing video and audio streams.
